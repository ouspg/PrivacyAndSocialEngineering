# Week 5: Social Engineering and Technology

Phishing is ranked as the number one cybercrime in 2022 based on the FBI's crime statistics [^10].

In Finland, phishing might be also the most visible cybercrime. 
In 2022, Finns lost 32,4 million euros for scams and frauds [^11].
Banks and media are constantly warning us about different phishing campaigns and schemes.
Many of us have received SMS messages or emails related to phishing.

In this exercise, we will try some simple phishing and counter-phishing technologies.


## Pre-requisites

You will likely need a working Linux machine for every task.

We provide guidance only for the course's virtual machine.
If you use other methods, you might need to explore a bit more by yourself.
On Slack, we can provide instructions for other platforms if needed.

On Arch Linux to install all the required tools:
```sh
sudo pacman -Sy --needed spamassassin whois ldns wget set
```

### Spamassassin

One of the oldest email spam filters is Apace's SpamAssassin[^15].
It can be used locally for single email messages, and on some tasks, it might be useful.

Spamassassin needs its rule list to be updated before we can do anything with it.
To update the rule list, run

```sh
sudo sa-update
```
Arch Linux [man pages](https://man.archlinux.org/man/spamassassin.1p) for how to use.

### whois

You will need [whois](https://github.com/rfc1036/whois) command-line tool or [website with similar features](https://who.is/) to query DNS owner information and make reverse IP lookup.

Arch Linux [man pages](https://man.archlinux.org/man/whois.1.en) for how to use.

### ldns

`drill` command from the [ldns](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/ldns) library will be used to query DNS records.

You can check Arch Linux [man pages](https://man.archlinux.org/man/drill.1) for how to use.

As a well-known alternative, you can also use `dig` command-line tool.

### The Social Engineering Toolkit 

[The Social Engineering Toolkit](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit) (SET or SEToolkit) is an open-source penetration testing framework[^1] designed for social engineering. It is being maintained by [TrustedSec](https://www.trustedsec.com/), a full-service Information Security consulting organization. 
They have created other useful tools as well, you can find these on their [GitHub](https://github.com/trustedsec).

Please note, that the Black Arch repository contains the `set` package in this case, and it cannot be normally installed with `pacman`. 

## Grading

You must do tasks **in order**.

You are expected to use more time on later tasks to get an equal amount of points than in previous tasks.

Task #|Points|Description|
-----|:---:|-----------|
[Task 1](#task-1-can-you-scam-me) | 2 | Can you... scam me?
[Task 2](#task-2-social-engineering-toolkit) | 1 | Social Engineering Toolkit

## Task 1: Can you... scam me?

Banking and other finance related is the most typical context where you might receive phishing messages, or where you are being targeted.

We will observe an email example related to banking, and how you might be able to verify, whether the message is coming from the claimed entity.

Additionally, we observe one scam message and how easy it is to make a cloned credential-stealing website.

### Task 1A) Email and URL phishing

Phishing as a term is originating from the context of email messages [^12].
Email technology was new back then, and it enabled efficiently "fish" sensitive information from unsuspicious users.

It was not designed to take spamming into account, and as a result, there are many attempted "fixes", such as spam filters, blacklists, DMARC, DKIM and SPF since then to reduce spamming.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs), cloud providers and VPNs often also block outgoing TCP port `25` these days to prevent email spamming. The port is used to relay messages from server to server. As a result, it is increasingly difficult to send an email directly from your own computer these days.


Let's have a look into the following ChatGPT-generated [^13] phishing message which has been sent via email.

> **Note**
> *The message is not related to the real S-Pankki in any way, and the bank is selected because of the linguistic properties of the name.*

```
Subject: Urgent Action Required: Verify Your Account Now
From: "S-Pankki Finland" <fraudprevention@spanki.fi>

Dear Customer,

We recently detected unusual activity on your bank account and have temporarily suspended your access to online banking for security reasons.

To restore your access, please click on the following link and verify your account information:

https://spanki.fi/verification/1021f-abs21-21441-225af

Please note that failure to verify your account within the next 24 hours will result in the permanent suspension of your online banking account.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

S-Pankki Finland
```
The full message in `.eml` format can be found [here](UrgentActionRequiredVerifyYourAccountNow.eml).
EML, short for electronic mail, is a common method for storing email messages [^14].

You can scan the message with `spamassassin` with the command to get the spam score.
```sh
spamassassin -t <FILENAME.eml>
```
It might or might not be useful. You can also ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) what it thinks about the message (but verify from true sources if its claims are correct).
If you don't want to give your phone number to use the service, you can use an unofficial and free [relay](https://chatgpt.org/chat). 
Please note, that it operates through API and does not remember the context of the session; your query must be submitted on a single message.


> i. What methods have been used on the message to convince the user to make an action and how the information is likely obtained?

Let's have a look at domains related to this message.

With `whois` tool, simply run `whois <domainname>`.


> ii. Who owns the domain `spanki.fi` related to the previous message? How about the domains `s-panki.fi` or `spankki.fi`?

These two latter domains are likely registered because of the [typosquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting).

How about `s-mobili.fi` and `smobili.fi`?

> iii. Is anyone capable to register free domain names, even similar to known brands? Take a brief look for registration requirements and process for `.fi` domains. Think about new registrations of S-Pankki domains.

> iv. Why it is so important pay attention to exact URLs and **why can we trust** the URLs in the first hand? Only a short explanation about the trust is required.

> v. Look for the sender from the .eml message. How the message has been sent? You should be able to identify the service.


DMARC, DKIM, and SPF are email sender authentication methods.
Take a short look [how they work](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/).



Check the `.eml` file from the previous section.

> vi. What headers are telling about DMARC, DKIM and SPF checks?

> vii. Now, do you think that these checks (especially the failure of them) will likely lead for previous mail to be deliver into spam rather than content on email server which has only SpamAssassin?

Take a look for **DNS TXT** records of the `op.fi`, `nordea.fi`, `poppankki.fi`, `saastopankki.fi` and `s-pankki.fi`. 

You can do it with `drill` command, for example `drill -t <domain> TXT`. DMARC record lives in the `_dmarc.*.` subdomain.

Also, DKIM records live in the other subdomain. Usually, the domain follows the name `<selector>._domainkey.<domain.com>`, as you can see from Cloudflare's documentation.
Sometimes it is challenging to find this information. 
First, you need to identify the mail service provider by looking `MX` records e.g. `drill -t <domain> MX`. Based on the service provider, you can look into their documentation to find out how they usually select the selector name. In Outlook, it is often `selector1` or `selector2`. To find the DKIM record for `nordea.fi` which uses Outlook, the record is found by using the command `drill -t selector1._domainkey.nordea.fi TXT`.

> viii. If you attempt to spoof some of these domain owners, in which cases the messages are not delivered regardless of the content? (Who has configured their servers correctly (also with DKIM and SPF) with `reject` policy?)

### Task 1B) Combining knowledge

Let's take a look at a totally different email message.

The message is [Hello.eml](Hello.eml), and is similar to the infamous Nigerian prince scenario.

Run the message with `spamassassin` and check email headers to validate sender authenticity.
Also, read it carefully.

After making your conclusions, you could ask ChatGPT what it thinks about the message. 
Remember to take it **with a grain of salt** whatever it is saying, and verify from true sources.

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer the following:</strong></summary>
<br>

> i. Will the message be delivered into the spam more likely because of the content rather than sending entity?

> ii. Identify at least five different psychological manipulation techniques what have been used in the message. 

</details>

### Task 1C) Building a credential-stealing site

Let's stop with the financial theme, and have fun with Netflix instead.

The website was missing from the phishing message in the first task.

How about we just... create one? How difficult it can be?

Depending on how the site has been constructed, it could be almost too easy. 
If it does not have many dynamical elements, it can be extremely easy to generate. 

We'll use the Netflix login page as an example.
There are many tools intended for cloning websites but will use just wget[^16].


```sh
wget -mk -nH netflix.com/fi-en/login
```

The command will download the site into the `fi-en` folder, following the URL structure.
Go into the folder, then rename `login` into `index.html`.

Run command `python3 -m http.server 3000` in the folder and navigate to `localhost:3000` in the browser.

Your clone should be pixel-perfect, including the favicon.

How complicated it would be to add some features?

You can take a quick look at the source code (index.html).
This is easier by using browser developer tools and inspecting the login element.
Login uses [HTML form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), with POST method and action is defined to be a relative 'login' route.

The basic `http.server` does not support `POST` method.
Your work is to add support for `POST` method for the following code.
It should be only a few lines of code. 

1. The function should log the content data of the POST request
2. The function should respond with response code `301`. 
3. The function should set the response header `Location: 'https://www.netflix.com/browse'`

Run the code in the same folder as `index.html`.



```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
import logging

class Netflix(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args, directory=".", **kwargs) # Use current directory to serve files

    def do_POST(self):
        # FIXME
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    server_address = ('', 3000) # Change first parameter to '0.0.0.0' to expose for outside network
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, Netflix)
    logging.info('Starting...\n')
    try:
        httpd.serve_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    httpd.server_close()
    logging.info('Stopping...\n')
```


<details>
<summary><strong>What to return:</strong></summary>
<br>

> Return the code and the screenshot of your Netflix phishing site and from the terminal, when it logs the user data after user submits it. You don't need to modify `index.html` in any way. What was the purpose of `301` response code and location header?

</details>

## **Task 2:** Social Engineering Toolkit

This task will focus on the Social Engineering Toolkit which was mentioned in pre-requisites.

The tool is very well documented in their "[SET user manual](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit#set-tutorial)" found on the tool's GitHub page.
We encourage you to explore this manual(`CTRL + F` is a friend) when using the tool. 

### **Task 2A)** QR Code[^2] Credential Harvest[^3]

Take a look at the SET's QR code creation tool and web attack type credential harvest. 
The credential harvester automates the process from the previous task, where we created the site, but with reduced control.

> **Note**
> However, you are allowed and recommended to continue using the code and methods from the previous task, as it allows more control. Changing the website is recommended.

In this task, we create a QR code for your self-hosted credential harvest page and **a poster** to try to get people to scan it.
We encourage you to get creative with your poster; it should seem legitimate.

**Think about the context**; why your poster would be attractive? Why people would scan the QR from it? What makes it less suspicious? You can think about the psychology behind it. Who is your target group? Be creative.
Use methods to reduce getting caught; e.g. use redirect to natural and real place after the user submits credentials.

You can set the address to the QR code and the harvester page as your local address (e.g. localhost, 192.168.0.0/16).

In a real-world situation, you would set it as your server's globally reachable address instead, which makes use of the HTTPS certificates[^4].
However, we skip that this time.
It is enough if you can test it with the computer and phone on the same network.

You can use any site you want; cloned, self-created or ready-to-use templates from the tool.
The only requirement is, that it has to have the capability to harvest credentials.


If you are using the code sample from the previous task to host your website, on your local computer, it could be trivial to make it accessible on the local network. Bind the server to address `0.0.0.0` and find your computer's local IP address to access it from your phone.

<details>
<summary><strong>What to return:</strong></summary>
<br>

- The poster with the QR code
- Scenario for usage. **Explain in detail** why your poster might be an effective way to collect credentials. Is it targeted to some specific group? Why it might work for them?
- The site used for harvesting. You can test the QR with your phone and open the site in its browser.  
- Screenshot of the credential harvest tool successfully returning you the input credentials (Your name as username and surname as password)

You can look for the following example poster, which would have a Twitter login page for credential harvesting and after entering your credentials it redirects you to the actual address, in this case, https://twitter.com/SecurityPelle. This example could be found at a cafe near an office you'd like to collect credentials from or at a lounge of a hotel if you're looking to gather a bunch of random credentials.

</details>

</details>

### **Task 2B)** Tool Walkthrough

SET has a plethora of cool and interesting utilities and you can create a huge arsenal of potential attacks with them. 
So in this task, you get to choose a tool or a set of tools to create a "walkthrough" for an attack.
Document the usage of the tool and provide at least one plausible use case for it.
You are required to include at least one image or video for the walkthrough.

Think of the walkthrough as teaching someone such as an employee, how to conduct your company's basic attack with the tool.

The walkthrough should make the usage of the tool clear and doable for people with at least some CLI experience.

**What to return:**  
- The walkthrough, included the use case, images and/or videos  
- Why you picked the tool or tools you chose
