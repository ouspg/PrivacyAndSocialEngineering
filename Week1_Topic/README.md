# **Week 1** 

## **Task 1:** GDPR Data Request

Create a GDPR-compliant data access request from a company of your choice. We recommend you choose a company you know holds data on you. The response may take some time, according to [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/right-of-access/) this **shouldn't** take more than a month from them receiving the request, however it might take longer than this depending on the company and your request. Therefore it is better to do it as soon as possible after starting the course.

You may use prewritten templates, however you should make sure the template used requests all of your data.

You can return to this assignment once you have received your information.

After receiving the answer to your data request answer the following questions. Keep your answers concise, focused and **at most** to 200 words.

1. Which company did you choose to request your data from and how long did they take to submit that information?
2. In what format did you receive your data and how many pages of it were there?
3. What kind of information was there that you had not directly given yourself? 
4. Were you surprised about something, what?
