# GDPR Data Request

Create a GDPR right of access data request from a company of your choosing. The response may take some time, according to GDPR this shouldn't take more than a month from them receiving the request, however it might take longer than this depending on the company and your request. Therefore it is better to do it as soon as possible after starting the course.

You may use prewritten templates, however the template might not be requesting all of your data.

You can return to this assignment once you have received your information.

1. In what kind of format did you receive your information?
2. How many pages of information there were?
3. What kind of information was there that you had not directly given yourself?
