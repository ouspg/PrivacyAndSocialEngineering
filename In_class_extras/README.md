## Wi-Fi deauthentication password attack

Wi-Fi deauthentication is a sort of DoS (denial-of-service) attack, where the attacker sends out deauthentication frames to devices connected to a certain AP (access point). When a device receives a deauthentication frame it will first be disconnected from the AP and then attempt to reconnect.
